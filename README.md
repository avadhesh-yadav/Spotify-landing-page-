# Spotify Landing Page Clone

This is a clone of the Spotify landing page created as a practice project to hone HTML and CSS skills. The goal of this project was to replicate the appearance and layout of Spotify's homepage using only HTML and CSS.

## Description

## Features

- Responsive design for various devices and screen sizes.
- Utilization of CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout.
- Styling components to match Spotify's branding and design language.
